plans.langstroth.introduction.title=Introduction
plans.langstroth.introduction.text1=When I started beekeeping – which wasn’t too long ago – I decided to build my own beehives. However, I quickly discovered that it was difficult to find comprehensive and clear instructions and drawings. While there is information out there, it’s often scattered and sometimes unclear. For this reason, I decided to create a document with detailed descriptions, both for my own benefit and to help others who are interested in building their own hives.
plans.langstroth.introduction.text2=These instructions are not the only way to go about it, but I hope they can serve as a good starting point for your hive-building journey.
plans.langstroth.introduction.text3=Please note that the drawings and descriptions may contain errors or room for improvement. Therefore, they are used at your own risk. However, I greatly appreciate any feedback on corrections or suggestions for improvement, so don’t hesitate to get in touch if you have any input!
plans.langstroth.introduction.text4=I have a background as a chef and now work as an IT technician. My passion for beekeeping and woodworking has been the driving force behind this project, and I’m excited to share my experiences with you.
